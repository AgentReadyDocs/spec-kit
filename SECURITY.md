# Security Policy

## Reporting

If you discover a security or safety issue, report it via GitHub Security Advisories when available.
Do not open a public issue with vulnerability details.

If advisories are unavailable, open a minimal public issue and request a private contact path (no exploit steps, no secrets, no customer data).

## Scope

These repositories may include templates, rubrics, prompts, and tooling assets.
Even with quality gates, outputs must be reviewed before production use in regulated or high-risk contexts.

## Sensitive Content

Do not disclose secrets, credentials, personal data, or customer-identifying information in issues, PRs, or examples.
